**Abstract:**   
Most of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesized during glucose metabolism
is produced in the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation. This is a
complex reaction powered by the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner
membrane, which is generated by mitochondrial respiration. A detailed model of
this reaction, which includes dynamic equations for the key mitochondrial
variables, was developed earlier by Magnus and Keizer. However, this model is
extraordinarily complicated. We develop a simpler model that captures the
behavior of the original model but is easier to use and to understand. We then
use it to investigate the mitochondrial responses to glycolytic and calcium
input. We use the model to explain experimental observations of the opposite
effects of raising cytosolic Ca(2+)in low and high glucose, and to predict the
effects of a mutation in the mitochondrial enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide
transhydrogenase (Nnt) in pancreatic beta-cells.
